<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>
We were given data about all registered voters, their demographics, and methods used to try to increase voter turnout. We analyzed the data in Python (with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib) using the Spyder IDE.

We looked at basic statistics from the November 2022 Midterm Election related to age, gender, and precinct in Harris County, Texas. Then, we computed the amount of money it cost BakerRipley to gain a vote per day of the week. We found that weekends (especially Sunday) were much more efficient than weekdays by comparing the amount of people contacted vs the amount of people reached. Next, we created a machine learning model that found the expected number of votes prior to BaerRipley's intervention. We computed the amount of money BakerRipley spent relative to the amount of votes that they gained with respect to the precincts that they targeted and the days of the week they canvassed. We ran t-tests for significance on all the combinations of precincts and days of the week to see where BakerRipley made a difference.

Finally, we computed the percent change in voting and created a precinct ranking system. We presented our recommendation to BakerRipley.

    We would like to thank the Rice Datathon committee, Rice University, BakerRipley, and all the sponsors for this wonderful opportunity and experience. Although this was our first Datathon, it will not be our last. We hope our mathematical model will shed some light on voting precincts and increasing voter turnout for subsequent elections.

    We would also like to thank our friends, parents, family, mentors, and professors for their unwavering support of our endeavors. We are eternally grateful.
